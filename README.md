Count the breaths.  
Stop counting.   
Notice breathing in and out.  
Let go of noticing.  
Be still and calm the breath.

7 limbs

I pay infinite homage to all great masters. I offer my body, speech, and mind. I confess all negative actions from desire, ignorance, anger, pride, and envy in your presence. I rejoice in the merit of all sentient beings and masters. Please give great and revolutionary teachings. Please great masters, for the benefit of all sentient beings, stay and help us. I dedicate all my virtue from this to the enlightenment of all beings!

The meaning of Dharma.  

The vulture, who soars through the skies, Descends for food by the power of desire. Doesn't it notice when it is caught in a snare? The white snow-lioness, who majestically poises on the glaciers, Strays down into the woods by the power of desire. Doesn't she notice when a blizzard has built up? The tiger, who lives in the sandalwood forests to the south, roams through ravines by the power of desire. Doesn't he notice when an avalanche is striking? The big fish, who swims through the waters, Chases bait by the power of desire. Doesn't she notice she is caught in a net? Your mind, the primordial buddha, Searches elsewhere by the power of desire. Doesn't it notice that it is wandering in samsara?

OM MAH-NE PAD-MAY HUNG.  

The Lord of Great Compassion, Avalokiteshvara, continuously looks upon the six classes of beings with compassion. Compassion means affection, and the compassion that has sentient beings as its focus is directed toward the six classes of beings, like the affection of a mother toward her only child. Avalokiteshvara gazes with overwhelming compassion toward all the six classes of sentient beings, who are tormented by misery. The compassion that has the Dharma as its focus is the six syllables of OM MAH-NE PAD-MAY HUNG. OM pacifies the suffering of the transmigration that the gods experience and makes them attain happiness. MAH pacifies the suffering caused by fighting that demigods perpetuate and makes them attain happiness. NE pacifies the suffering of serfdom and poverty that human beings undergo and makes them attain happiness. PAD pacifies the suffering of stupidity that animals endure and makes them attain happiness. MAY pacifies the suffering of hunger and thirst that hungry ghosts experience and makes them attain happiness. HUNG pacifies the suffering of heat and cold that hell beings perceive and makes them attain happiness. The compassion that is beyond a focus is to perceive the interruption of the samsaric sufferings of the six classes of beings, OM MAH-NE PAD-MAY HUNG. OM interrupts the abyss of rebirth as a god and empties the realm of gods. MAH interrupts the abyss of rebirth as a demigod being and empties the realm of demigods. NE interrupts the abyss of rebirth as a human being and empties the realm of humans. PAD interrupts the abyss of rebirth as an animal and empties the realm of animals. MAY interrupts the abyss of rebirth as a hungry ghost and empties the realm of hungry ghosts. HUNG interrupts the abyss of rebirth as a hell being and empties the realm of the hells. Having emptied the abodes of the six classes of beings, the realms of samsara are emptied into primordial purity. Thus, the Six Syllables, the quintessence of the great Compassionate One, have the power to lead sentient beings to the buddha-fields.

Testaments

Do not forget that life flickers by and then you die.
What meets must part, so do not fight and cause strife.
What is gathered must be abandoned, so do not crave intemperately for wealth.
Attachment is bondage, so do not harbor unbridled clinging.
What is born must die, so think of your next life.
This life is only on loan; no one knows when it will be lost.
Appearances are illusory, understand their impermanence.
Food and wealth are like dew drops; it is uncertain when they disappear.
Enmity, the state of mind or feeling of being actively opposed or hostile to someone or something is delusion; understand it to be mistaken.

Guard the general welfare of others with your lives.
Do not take an oath in vain.
Be strict about what is prohibited.
Be in agreement when you assemble.
Do not show disdain for the destitute.

Whatever you do, first think well.
To act without forethought creates many problems.

When something can be corrected,
What is the use of remaining displeased?
When something cannot be changed,
Why harbor ill-will?

If you progress slowly, at some point you will arrive.
If you circumvent places of danger, you will not be harmed by enemies.
If you speak gently, everyone will understand.
Loud and harsh orders have only short term effect.

If you act diligently anything can be accomplished.
Being rash and inconstant only makes you tired.

To resolve the view, ask those who have realization.
To practice meditation, listen to those who have experience and understanding.
To engage in conduct, mingle meditation and post-meditation.

Do not get entranced by words; instead, scrutinize their meaning.

The real yogi is your unfabricated innate nature.
Yogi means to realize the wisdom of pure awareness.

Be free from ambition in the view; do not indulge in unfair favoritism.
Be free from reference point in the meditation; do not indulge in fixating your mind.
Be free from accepting and rejecting in the conduct; do not indulge in clinging to a self.
Be free from abandonment and attainment in the fruition; do not indulge in grasping to things as real.

Appearances are delusion; do not indulge in ordinariness.

Wealth is illusory; do not indulge in craving.

Be detached and free from clinging; do not indulge in attachment.
